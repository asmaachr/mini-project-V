    "Over 100 million people visit Quora every month, so it's no surprise that many people ask similar (or the same) questions. Various questions with the same intent can cause people to spend extra time searching for the best answer to their question, and results in members answering multiple versions of the same question. Quora uses random forest to identify duplicated questions to provide a better experience to active seekers and writers, and offer more value to both of these groups in the long term.\n",
